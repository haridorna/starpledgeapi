Flavoring was perfect.\n Roasted Maine Lobster: Lobster is lobster. Mashed potatoes that came with was very buttery.\n Lemon Pepper Duck Breast: The sauce that accompanied the duck was very yummy, but have to say that the duck itself was not as tender as I imagined it would be. I have had better at other places.\n Juniper Crusted Bison: Started to slow down a lot by this course. If I am comparing to the rest, this would be my least favorite. Bison meat is a bit tough. Sauce is very savory though.\n Last course was dessert, Chocolate Souffle: The chocolate in the souffle was very decadent and rich, but bread part was very dry. Overall was just OK.",
